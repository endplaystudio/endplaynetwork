# This is the English language file that Navigator uses to formulate it's navigation instructions.
# CARDINALDIR will get replaced with a cardinal direction. For example, "Go towards the CARDINALDIR" will become "Go towards the North".
# DESTRNAME will be replaced by the name of the destination.
# WORLDNAME will be replaced with, obviously, a world name.
# Word replacment only applies to the sentences that currently contain a replaced world.
# /nl creates a new line.
# Compatible with Navigator v1.5.2
