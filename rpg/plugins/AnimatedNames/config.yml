# About: Everyone knows plugins that allow you to have your group name
#		 in front of your name above your head. But this plugin does more then that
#        with over 180+ placeholders and more to come every update this plugin not only
#        allows placeholders in your name above your head but it also allows the name to
#        be animated.

# Permissions: To use the animatednames groups give them the permission
#              animatednames.group.<group>  (ex. animatednames.group.default)
#              Make sure to remove them from the other groupsd
#              when giving a new permission.

tweaks:
  # If you have issues with non-legacy mode try this option. The option is more CPU intensive,
  # but it is meant to detect problems
  synchronized: false
  # Setting this to true will keep tab names untouched
  # Useful for those who do not want to change tab names but
  # only the names above.
  # NOTE: This shrinks the tab name by 2 chars
  # so if you have a long name it becomes shorter
  # This may also break nicknames in the tab
  white-tabnames: false
