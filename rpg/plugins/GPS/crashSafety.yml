# This is a crash safety storage file for GPS arrow entity UUIDs.
# 
# Once an arrow is created the entity UUIDs are stored internally and in this file.
# The UUIDs are then removed once the GPS arrow is stopped.
# The UUIDs will remain in this file and is not lost should the server unexpectedly crash for whatever reason.
# This file is checked on restart. If the server contains an entity with the given UUID it is removed.
# 
# Do NOT edit this file manually unless you know exactly what you are doing.
