The files contained in this particles folder will be reset every server start-up!

So DON'T try to edit these files!

If you want to create your own recipes, do that by using CustomCrafting or create your own plugin that loads them (documentation not yet available).

If you use CustomCrafting:

1.  Go into your recipes folder and then in the preffered namespace. e.g. recipes/customcrafting

2.  There you create a folder called "particles". (e.g. recipes/customcrafting/particles)

3.  Inside of the particles folder you create 2 files:
    particles.json
    particle_effects.json

4.  Edit the files. You can use the WolfyUtilities default files as an example.
