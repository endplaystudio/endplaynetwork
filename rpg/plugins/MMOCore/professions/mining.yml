# This part of the config is ONLY for custom mining.
# Custom Mining must be setup in config.yml and it
# will render any block not referenced in here as unminable.
# If you do not wish to use custom mining it is recommended
# to follow the format in woodcutting.yml for experience and
# configure drop tables with MMOItems.
# Block Regen is currently only possible using custom mining.
