# # ==============================
# #        TUTORIAL (v1.0.3)
# # ==============================
# #
# # - Format: 'LEVEL=<level_number>:<condition/effect/option>=<condition/effect/option_value>'
# # - Set TARGET: You can set the target(entity) using "TARGET=<TARGET_ENTITY>" read supported targets in 'Events' section, default target is 'SELF' ('SELF' is the player that casted the ability).
# # - Set LOCATION: You can set location if you want to modify current target location, use: "LOCATION=<LEFT_RIGHT>,<BACK_FORWARD>,<UP_DOWN>,<ANGLE>" (ex: 'triple_arrow_shot' ability).
# # - Set PROJECTILE_TRAIL: You can set projectile trail using: "PROJECTILE_TRAIL=<PARTICLE_TYPE>,<TICKS>" (ex: 'explosive_arrow' ability).
# # - Set CHANCE_TO_RUN: You can set chance to run a condition, option, effect: "CHANCE_TO_RUN=<NUMBER>" (ex: 'vampire_mode' ability).
# # - Set RANDOM: You can create a ID list and the plugin will choose a condition, option, effect randomly: "RANDOM=<ID>" (ex: 'pirate' ability).
# # - Set CONDITION: You can set a condition to run a condition, option, effect: "CONDITION=<CONDITION_FROM_LIST=CONDITION_VALUES>" (ex: 'mining_luck' ability).
# # - Set CONDITION_OR: You can use this when you want to get a 'true' value in many conditions, example checking blocks or player hand items: "CONDITION_OR=<ID>" (ex: 'aggressive_mode' ability).
# # - Use custom variables/placeholders to get a specific value:
# #   * {SELF_NAME}.
# #   * {SELF_HEALTH}.
# #   * {SELF_MAX_HEALTH}.
# #   * {ENTITY_NAME}.
# #   * {ENTITY_HEALTH}.
# #   * {ENTITY_MAX_HEALTH}.
# #   * {BOW_POWER}.
# #   * {EVENT_DAMAGE}.
# #   * {BLOCK_TYPE}.
# #   * {DROP_TYPE}.
# #   * {BLOCK_DROP_SIZE}.
# #   * {RANDOM_NUMBER;<MAX_NUMBER>}.
# #   * {RANDOM_NUMBER;<MIN_NUMBER>_<MAX_NUMBER>}.
# #   * {STORAGE_<ID>}. | This is the global ability storage
# #   * {PLAYER_STORAGE_<ID>}. | This storage is only for the player but it will never be removed.
# #   * {PLAYER_UNIQUE_STORAGE_<ID>}. | This storage is only for the player but it will be removed when ability ends.
# # - Use !INVERSE to inverse the condition, example if you are using 'HEARTS' condition then plugin will check if the entity has
# #   more hearts than the condition value, but if you add !INVERSE, plugin checks if the entity has less hearts than the condition value.
# #   Example: LEVEL=1:HEARTS=5!INVERSE
# # - Use !IGNORE_CHECK to skip value verification! (example: "GREATER_THAN=1,{PLAYER_UNIQUE_STORAGE_TEST}!IGNORE_CHECK", because "{PLAYER_UNIQUE_STORAGE_TEST}" isn't a number.
# # - Use !INSTANT_EVENT_CALL to call the event instantly instead of wait current event ends.
# # - Use "Arithmetic Operators symbols":
# #   * Addition: 2 + 2
# #   * Subtraction: 2 - 2
# #   * Multiplication: 2 * 2
# #   * Division: 2 / 2
# #   * Exponentiation: 2 ^ 2
# #   * Unary Minus, Plus(Sign Operators): +2 - (-2)
# #   * Modulo: 2 % 2
# #   Example: LEVEL=1:HEARTS=({ENTITY_HEALTH}/5)*2
# # - Be careful adding 'condition/effect/option' with big values, this can affect the server performance!
# # - Use "/abilities creator info" to see all DAMAGE_CAUSES, SPECIAL_PARTICLES, PARTICLES, SOUNDS, POTION_EFFECTS available in your server version!
# # - See all events, conditions, effects, options using "/abilities creator <events/conditions/effects/options>".
