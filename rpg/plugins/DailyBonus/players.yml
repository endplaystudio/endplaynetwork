# Player File
# 
# This file is used to store all player data based on their UUID.
# If the server is ever stopped or restarted it will save all of
# the current players delay times whether it be the day timer or
# the waiting timer and restart all of them upon starting the server.
# 
# Because the plugin depends on this file to save vital data on stops/restarts
# it is highly recommended that you DO NOT edit this fie while the server is on!
